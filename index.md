## Projects
### Secondary database search method based on sequence tag strategy

* Proposes an iterative search method, which is helpful to solve the problem of low identification rate and time-consuming in metaproteomics and protein genomics domain of traditional protein search engine.
* Prepare to submit to **Journal of proteome**.  

### Information Retrieval System Based on BM25 Model (python)

* Use the BM25 model to complete the rerank of the query results, test it on the TREC2019 sub dataset, and the NDCG@10 index is 0.1675.  


### Mass sorting of floating-point numbers with limited memory capacity (C++)

* It is required to sort 250 million decimal random floating-point numbers under the limit of 512MB memory usage.  
* Using codec technology, loser tree algorithm and multi-threading ideas, generate a 4.28GB dataset randomly, test the program under the hardware conditions of a 2.30GHz quad-core CPU, and all tasks can be completed in 77 seconds.  

### Automatic sign language recognition application (python)  

* The SIFT algorithm was used to extract sign language features based on mobile phone camera, and then LIBSVM was used to recognize them.

## Skills

* Familiar with  C++，python

* Know  C, JAVA and LaTeX

* CET-6: 504; CET-4: 548
